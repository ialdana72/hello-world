# hello-world

My first repository on GitHub

I am 20 years old and a junior in univeristy studying Computer Science. My goal is to become a software engineer and to one day spesifically dive into Machine Learning engineering. My hobbies include recording music with friends and learning Logic Pro X more in depth to make my music sound as professional as possible.
